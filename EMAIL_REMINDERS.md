# Email Reminder System for Recurring Payments

## Overview
The application now includes an automated email reminder system that sends notifications to users one day before their recurring payments are due.

## Features

### 1. Automatic Creation Confirmation
- When a user creates a new recurring payment, they receive an immediate confirmation email
- Email includes all payment details (amount, frequency, category, due dates)

### 2. Daily Due Date Reminders
- Automated system checks daily for payments due tomorrow
- Sends reminder emails 24 hours before each payment is due
- Includes payment details and direct link to manage payments

## Implementation Details

### Email Service Integration
- Uses Resend API for reliable email delivery
- Production-ready with environment-based email configuration
- Supports both development and production domains

### Cron Job Configuration
- Automated daily execution at 9:00 AM UTC via Vercel Cron Jobs
- Manual trigger endpoint available for testing: `/api/cron/daily-reminders`
- Secure authentication with `CRON_SECRET` environment variable

### Smart Date Calculation
- Accurately calculates next due dates based on start date and frequency
- Handles all frequency types: weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly
- Accounts for recurring cycles that have already begun

## API Endpoints

}
```
